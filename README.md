# ðŸ–§ Cisco Packet Tracer Network Simulation Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer project simulating a complex network topology. The project includes various networking components and configurations to demonstrate the setup of a detailed and functional network environment.

## Configuration Details

The following configurations have been implemented in the network topology:

- **Routing Protocols**: RIP, OSPF, EIGRP  
- **Switching Technologies**: EtherChannel, HSRP  
- **Access Control**: VLAN configurations, SSH access  
- **IP Addressing**: Static and dynamic IP addressing (DHCP)  
- **Bandwidth and Delay**: Adjusted for different network scenarios  
- **Network Services**: DNS, Web, Email, and Smart Phone configurations  

## Detailed Implementation Instructions

### Key Points Covered in the Configuration Guide

1. **Device Initialization**:
    - Assigning IP addresses to routers and PCs.
    - Setting up VLANs for segmented network traffic.
2. **Protocol Configuration**:
    - Configuring RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP for dynamic routing.
    - Implementing EtherChannel for link aggregation.
3. **Access and Security**:
    - Setting up SSH for secure remote access.
    - Limiting the SSH access only for one device (Mother of Net Admin).
    - Configuring HSRP for high availability.
    - Implementing security good practices like Black Hole VLANs.
4. **Network Services**:
    - DNS and DHCP configuration.
    - Web and email server setups.
    - Smart Phone integration within the network.
5. **Performance Tuning**:
    - Adjusting bandwidth and delay settings for different network segments.
